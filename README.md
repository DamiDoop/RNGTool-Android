## System Requirements
- At least Android 8.0 or higher
## Installation
RNGTool Android is still in very early beta stages, so no builds are currently distributed through either GitHub Actions or Releases. For now, you'll have to import the project into Android Studio and build it for yourself. Expect builds soon!
